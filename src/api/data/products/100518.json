  "name": "Loctite Metal/Concrete Epoxy Syringe",
  "description": "Loctite Epoxy Metal/Concrete is a two-part system consisting of an epoxy resin and a hardener. The convenient syringe dispenses equal amounts of each component every time. When mixed in equal volumes, resin and hardener react to produce a tough, rigid, high strength bond in 5 to 12 minutes. It is used as an adhesive for repairing, filling and rebuilding all metal and concrete surfaces. Loctite Epoxy Metal/Concrete does not conduct electricity which is ideal for sealing electrical components. It cures to a metallic gray finish and can be easily sanded or machined. It does not shrink and is resistant to water and most common solvents.California residents: see\u0026nbsp;Proposition 65 informationProvides a permanent, high-strength bond in concrete and metal repair projectsWorks great on railings, awnings, posts, brick, concrete and cinderblockConvenient dual syringe allows the perfect mixture of resin and hardener in every applicationBond sets after 5 minutes and fully cures in 24 hoursWill not conduct electricity, can be used to seal electrical componentsResistant to water, solvents, moisture and impactCan be painted and sanded",
