  "description": "The 9-3/8 sq. ft. Cape Cod MDF V-Groove Wainscot Plank Paneling is pre-primed for simple painting. The planks feature a tongue-and-groove design and a white color. Due to flexibility our Primed, MDF Planks are the perfect alternative to using drywall in the building of a cottage. In extreme weather, drywall tends to expand, contract and separate, while Cape Cod MDF V-Groove Wainscot Plank Paneling will move, allowing for expansion and contraction through summer and winter. The inter-locked tongue and groove combined keeps these planks from sagging. These planks can be installed to replace drywall.California residents: see\u0026nbsp;Proposition 65 informationManufactured from MDFTongue-and-groove designWhite color9 sq. ft. coveragePre-primed for easy paintingIncludes 6 planksNote: product may vary by store",
