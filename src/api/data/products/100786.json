  "name": "DuctlessAire 12000 BTU Mini Split Air Conditioner with HEPA",
  "description": "The 12,000 BTU DuctlessAire Mini Split with variable speed DC Inverter compressor provides a highly efficient, quite, low cost professional solution for your cooling and heating needs without requiring any ductwork. This energy efficient system is the ideal solution for open room applications such as classrooms, sunrooms, open floor plan flexible use spaces, man caves, home theatres, offices, studios, bedrooms, bonus rooms over the garage and even basements and garages where heating and cooling is desired. Where there is an open interior space need for heating and cooling, DuctlessAire Mini Splits have the answer. This sleek looking unit is mounted on the wall working in concert with an exterior condenser requiring only a small hole to run the lines from the air handler to the condenser. The fans deliver continuous air flow and circulation with year round temperature comfort and are easily adjusted with a remote control that comes standard with each unit. Because the air handler is mounted above eye level, it is esthetically attractive, blends well and does little to impede with furniture and decor placement. DuctlessAire Mini Splits are fast becoming America\u0027s solution for large and small interior space comfort and can be installed in just a few hours.Package includes: stylishly designed interior white wall mount air handler with led display; exterior pre-charged condenser with special golden anti-corrosive coating coils; wireless remote control for effortless air flow and temperature adjustment; 25 ft. complete kit25 ft. kit includes: copper tubing with insulation and nuts, control wire, 6 ft. drain hose, wall sleeve, wall sleeve cover and tapeGolden fin anti-corrosive condenser: the golden hydrophilic condenser improves the heating efficiency by accelerating the defrosting process, the unique anti-corrosive golden coating on the condenser also aids in withstanding the effects of salty air, rain and other corrosive elements by allowing contaminated water on the coil to run off more quickly reducing the corrosive effect to the coil, heat exchange performance is much longer lastingLow ambient operation: a special built-in low ambient kit can be used in temperatures as low as 5F for cooling operation, useful for users who need to maintain cooling during winterRefrigerant leak detection: with this new technology the system will alarm when a refrigerant leak is detectedFollow me feature: by pressing the follow me\u0027 button and keeping the remote close to you, you tell the air conditioner to set the temperature from wherever the remote happens to be, this counteracts the tendency for the air conditioner to stop cooling or heating because the air around the unit has reached its set temperature (switches off after period of inactivity to preserve battery life)HEPA filter included (1): a HEPA filter is a type of mechanical air filter; it works by forcing air through a fine mesh that traps harmful particles such as pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and tobacco smoke2 direction air vane technology: in cooling mode the air vane opens counter clockwise to direct the air horizontally, allowing for an even cooling effect, in heating mode the air vane opens clockwise directing the air downwards, this time for an even heating effectBuilt-in electronic diagnostic: monitoring some abnormal operations or parts failures, microcomputer of the air conditioner will switch off and protect the system automatically; meanwhile, the error or protection code will be displayed on the indoor unitOutdoor pan heater: a heating belt is fitted on the base plate of the outdoor unit to avoid accumulation of rain, snow or water on the base plateDual washable filters: a good air conditioner should not only take care of the temperature in your home but also the quality of the air you breathe, the system aids in removing most of the pollen dust, smoke and other microscopic airborne particles that by latest thinking contribute to respiratory problems like asthma and hay feverSelf cleaning: by pressing clean on the remote control automatically cleans the evaporator to aid in reducing build-up of bacteria and keep the air freshSleep mode: in sleep mode, the unit automatically decreases the heating or increases the cooling by 1 per hour for the first 2 hours of use, then holds the temperature steady for 5 hours before ceasing operationLow noise airflow system: without decreasing the airflow volume and capacity output, large diameter cross flow fan can bring down the indoor unit noise level by lowering the fan speedAnti cold draft: if the unit is turn on in heat mode when the ambient temperature is low it will warm up prior to fan operation to prevent cold air in heating mode to make people feel more comfortableLouver position memory: the set louver position is stored in memory by the microcomputer, and the louver returns to the stored position when the next operation is performedTurbo mode: this function enables the unit to reach the preset temperature in the shortest time",
