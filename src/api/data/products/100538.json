  "description": "The Ranger 2-in-1 pole saw/chainsaw is lightweight and easy for anyone to use. The chainsaw has a 10 in. bar and chain that is perfect for trimming small to medium sized branches. The powerful 8 Amp engine drives the saw with a 10 in. kickback bar and chain, with a quick option to convert from pole saw to chainsaw. Attached to the telescoping pole, the saw has the ability to cut high branches up to reach 10 to 15 ft. overhead (depending on user\u0027s height) to easily trim high branches and tree limbs.California residents: see\u0026nbsp;Proposition 65 information8 Amp engine10 in. bar and chain10 ft. reach extension capabilityAdjustable telescoping poleQuick and tool-less conversion from pole saw to chainsawUpper and lower telescoping extensionsManual oilerTraditional tension system2-year limited warrantyHome Depot Protection Plan:",
