  "description": "Relax the look of any room with the calm and comforting Driftwood Flatweave Bamboo Roman Shade. Environmentally friendly, semi-private textured natural shades (also called bamboo blinds, bamboo shades, or woven woods) stylishly filter light and protect your furniture from fading. The rich wood tones of natural shades are complimentary to jute and sisal rugs as well as many hardwood floor and furniture finishes. Natural shades are textured window blinds that are available in many different colors and styles. They are popular window treatments for coastal and beach properties, lakeside or country cottages, and traditional or metropolitan homes. For additional privacy or neutral backing, you can attach a fabric privacy liner to the back side of natural shades. Another option for additional privacy is to outside mount natural shades, then inside mount an inexpensive white black out roller blind. Fabric privacy liners and black out roller blinds both can be purchased on homedepot.com.23 in. W x 72 in. LActual blind width size is 22.5 in.NOTE: This blind is 0.5 in.
