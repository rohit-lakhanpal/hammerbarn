  "description": "The Wooster 9 in. Professional Roller Frame has a unique retaining spring that securely holds the roller to prevent it from walking off a cage. After painting, the cover removes with a single rap of the frame on the edge of a paint bucket. Its twin bearing system eliminates friction that causes graying and streaking in paint. The cage provides uniform, full-span support of the roller cover to prevent it from going out of round. Its handle is threaded for easy attachment to all extension poles.Durable fiberglass-reinforced nylon cage and end capsPolypropylene grip with reinforced threadsRetaining spring securely holds the rollerSmooth bearings eliminate graying and shank wearThreaded handle for easy attachment to all extension polesCover removes with a single rap of the frame on the edge of a paint bucketMade in USA",
