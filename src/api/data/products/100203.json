  "description": "Chiaro Brick Tumbled Travertine Mosaic Tile has small depressions and crevices within each stone to project a rustic, old-world charm. Predominantly beige and cream, these 12 in. x 12 in. mesh-mounted tiles from MS International exhibit random tone variations and coordinate with nearly any commercial or residential decor theme. They interconnect seamlessly, making large-scale tiling projects look like each brick was laid individually and spaced perfectly. NOTE: Inspect all tiles before installation. Natural stone products inherently lack uniformity and are subject to variation in color, shade, finish, etc. It is recommended to blend tiles from different boxes when installing. Natural stones may be characterized by dry seams and pits that are often filled. The filling can work its way out and it may be necessary to refill these voids as part of a normal maintenance procedure. All natural stone products should be sealed with a penetrating sealer.
