  "description": "Waxes are applied easily with a brush or a soft, clean rag. By using a wax instead of a varnish, you have more control over how the finished piece will look. Dark waxes can be used on top of Clear Waxes to add an authentic antique look. Waxes also offer a soft, smooth finish that can be buffed to a glossy sheen if desired.Water-based, low odorFor a protected matte finish, just rub on without buffing, Buffing will create a glossier sheen, No need to re-apply wax - initial coat provides long lasting durabilityApply sparingly, do not over wax, too much wax will leave a finished surface feeling tacky, rub off excess waxWaxes clean easily off brushes with soap and water, finished pieces can also be cleaned gently with a damp rag",
