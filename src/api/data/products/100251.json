  "description": "Western Red Cedar is a unique and prestigious softwood with outstanding physical characteristics. It offers a rare combination of aesthetic appeal and durability, thanks to its natural decay-resistant composition.  Western Red Cedar\u0027s superior dimensional stability means that, when properly installed and maintained, project components are likely to stay straight and flat, and resist warping and cupping - season after season. In addition, cedar is easy to cut, saw and nail with common tools.California residents: see\u0026nbsp;Proposition 65 informationAppearance grade with tight sound knots and little to no waneLumber has a rough sawn surface for a natural appearanceEasy to finish with solid or oil-based stains and clear penetrating sealersGreat for outdoor projects like fences or pergolas and gazebosCedar\u0027s decay resistance allows it to be used in weather exposed applications, without a chemical treatmentNote: Product may vary by store.",
